PROBLEMS.
1. Unutilized and Unreliable Data in Agriculture.
Over the years, several data about agriculture has been and its still being collected. This data
consists of soil variations, weather patterns, water level, climatic conditions, satellite geo
maps of areas of crop production, soil erosion tracking, change in wind and rain fall
patterns. All this data has been left redundant without any analytical solutions applied to it
and if any most farmers have no or limited access to such analytics leave alone analyzing
their own data.
2. Luck of Collaboration tool for Farmers.
Today many social networking sites exist but not one directly made for farmers. This posses
a problem since many farmers luck tools to allow them network and share ideas at Realtime
and checkout what others are up to.
3. Luck of Proper Digital Record Management and Tracking tool for Farmers.
Farmers have faced challenges of records management systems which some are very
complicated and some being too simple and doesn’t solve their problem. Many have
resorted to excel workbooks to keep records of purchase and this limits the type of data
saved in such workbooks. Farmers are unable to easily see changes made to their records.
SOLUTION
1. Analytics tool.
Data collected from devices in gardens and public repository will provide the data to be
used for Analytics. This will be presented inform of a dashboard on a web app that shows
current agricultural data and trends in terms of charts, graphs, tables and 3D models. The
data displayed will range from climatic conditions and changes, weather patterns, soil
changes or variations, sun tracking, water level to price of commodities and changes by
which they occur. This will help solve the problem of unutilized and unrealizable data for
agriculture.
2. Collaboration tool.
This will be the “social media” for farmers and agriculturist. A place for people to interact
and share ideas and keep updated with current trends in agriculture. Members will be able
to setup profiles and get followers and be verified to show authenticity. Members will be
able to chat and call each other on the same platform. This will help to solve the problem of
luck of collaboration tools for farmers.
3. Records management and Tracking tool.
This idea is based on features used In many software development tools today to keep
changes made by a developer, in the same way farmers will create repositories of their
various projects they are engaged in and keep updating it and all the changes will be tracked
and monitored to show the steps the farmer has been taking to work on such a project.
Farmers will be able to store any other related data with fast navigation to access each
project.
